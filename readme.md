📄 DocuChat: Multi-Doc AI Assistant

DocuChat is a streamlined, AI-powered research tool that allows users to upload multiple PDF and DOCX documents and interact with them using natural language. Built with Streamlit and Google Gemini, it uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, context-aware answers and summaries.

🚀 Features

Multi-Document Support: Upload and analyze multiple PDF and DOCX files simultaneously.

Instant Summarization: Automatically generates a concise summary of all uploaded content upon processing.

Context-Aware Chat: Ask questions and get answers based strictly on the provided documents.

Privacy-Focused: All data is processed in a temporary session and cleared when the page is refreshed. No permanent storage.

Fast & Efficient: Uses PyMuPDF for rapid text extraction and ChromaDB for high-speed vector search.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: Streamlit

LLM: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (via google-generativeai)

Vector Store: ChromaDB

Embeddings: Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

Text Extraction: PyMuPDF (PDFs) and python-docx (Word docs)

⚙️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run the application locally.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/docuchat.git](https://github.com/yourusername/docuchat.git)
cd docuchat


2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's best practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Configure API Key

You need a Google Gemini API key to run the model.

Get your key from Google AI Studio.

Create a folder named .streamlit in the root directory.

Inside that folder, create a file named secrets.toml.

Add your key to the file:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_here"


▶️ Usage

Start the application:

streamlit run app.py


The app will open in your default browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).

Sidebar: Use the "Upload Documents" button to select one or more PDF/DOCX files.

Click "Process & Summarize".

Wait for the summary to appear in the chat.

Type your questions in the chat input box to query your documents.

🧠 How It Works

Ingestion: The app extracts text from uploaded files.

Chunking: Text is split into smaller, overlapping chunks to preserve context.

Embedding: The all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model converts these chunks into vector embeddings.

Storage: Embeddings are stored in a temporary, in-memory ChromaDB collection.

Retrieval: When you ask a question, the system searches for the most relevant text chunks.

Generation: The relevant chunks + your question are sent to Gemini 2.5 Flash, which generates an answer based solely on that context.
